# Object Detection YOLO* V3 C++ Demo, Async API Performance Showcase

### Running with CoreDLA
In addition to the options described below, include the arguments:

-  `-plugins=<path the plugins.xml>`, using the path to [plugins.xml](../plugins.xml)
- `-d HETERO:FPGA,CPU`
- `-arch_file <path to arch file>`, using the path to the architecture used when creating the FPGA bitstream

Use the -build_demo option to the runtime/build_runtime.sh script to build the demos.

See the documentation that is included with the example design.
