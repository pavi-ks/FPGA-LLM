// The interface of the interrupt service routine dictates that all the data the ISR needs must be passed in through
// one pointer of type void *. Package it up here. WaitForDla() uses jobsWaited and jobsFinished to determine if a job
// has already finished or it still needs wait. The ISR only updates jobsFinished, so jobsWaited is only a member of
// CoreDlaDevice. The mutex and condition variable are used to synchronize between InterruptServiceRoutine() and
// WaitForDla(). All of these are replicated per CoreDLA IP instance, hence the use of vector.
// base_multiplier and prevCount are used to handle the jobsFinished wrap-around that could happen in the hardware CSR
// as the CSR is only 32-bit wide but the jobsFinished is 64-bit wide
